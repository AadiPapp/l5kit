    "# Introduction to DriveNet\n",
    "\n",
    "DriveNet is a DNN able to drive an agent on a specific route. Among others, DriveNet can do lane-following while respecting traffic lights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imitation Learning and Its limitations\n",
    "DriveNet is trained using imitation learning on our Lyft L5 Prediction Dataset 2020. We feed examples of real driving experiences to the model and expect it to take the same actions as the driver did in those episodes. This is very similar to how tasks like classification are usually solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imitiation Learning is powerful, but it has a strong limitation. It's not trivial for a trained model to generalise well on out-of-distribution data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training DriveNet, we would like it to take full control and drive the AV in an autoregressive fashion (i.e. by following its own predictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario it's very easy for errors to compound and make the AV drift away from the original distribution. During training our DriveNet has seen good examples of driving only. In particular, this means **almost perfect midlane following**. However, even a small constant displacement during evaluate can accumulate enough error to lead the AV completely out of its distribution in a matter of seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "![drifting](../../images/drivenet/drifting.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you're going to train your own Drivenet model using Lyft L5 Dataset and L5Kit. You will use a technique named **online trajectory perturbation** to mitigate the effects of drifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before starting, please download the [Lyft L5 Prediction Dataset 2020](https://self-driving.lyft.com/level5/prediction/) and follow [the instructions](https://github.com/lyft/l5kit#download-the-datasets) to correctly organise it.**\n"

A new ground truth trajectory is then generated to link this new starting point with the original trajectory end point. These starting point will be slightly rotated and off the original midlane, and the new trajectory will teach the model how to recover from this situation.\n",
